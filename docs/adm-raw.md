# Protocol for WIMS direct connection with other web servers

WIMS direct communication with another web server is two-directional.
It can receive http/https requests from the other server, and/or send http/https requests to the other.
The connectable server must be declared in a file
within the directory `WIMS_HOME/log/classes/.connections/`.

Requests sent to WIMS should obey the format described below. Results of such requests can be formatted according to the need of the connecting software.

Outgoing requests sent by WIMS can be formatted according to the
specification of the receiving software,
while the result of the request should be formatted according to the need of WIMS, as described below.

_________________________________________________________________
## Request format

A request from a connecting server is an http/https request sent to the main cgi program of the WIMS server, followed by parameter definitions as in a usual http protocol.

All requests must contain the following common parameters:

---
| Name   | Value                      |
|--------|----------------------------|
| module | adm/raw |
| ident  | sender identifier (a word, according to the definition in `WIMS_HOME/log/classes/.connections/`) |
| passwd | sender password (as defined in `WIMS_HOME/log/classes/.connections/`) |
| code   | a random word. This word will be sent back to the sender, in order to allow it to check whether the result is from the good request. |
| job    | type of request, see below. |



 And the following parameters may be added according to the type
of the request.

| Name     | Value                      |
|----------|----------------------------|
| qclass   | identifier of the class on the receiving server. It should be an integer. |
| qprogram |  	|
| quser    | user identifier in the receiving server (when the request concerns a particular user). 	|
| qsheet   | sheet identifier in the receiving server (when the request concerns a particular sheet). 	|
| rclass   | identifier of the class on the sending server. |
| format   | Format of the data. |
| option   | Different meaning according to request. |
| data1    | Different meaning according to request. |


For example, the following request checks whether the class `12345` exists on
the WIMS server `wims.unice.fr`, sent by a connecting server called `friend1` (by
wims.unice.fr), with password `abcde`.

`https://wims.unice.fr/wims/wims.cgi?module=adm/raw&amp;ident=friend1&amp;passwd=abcde&amp;code=afdqreaf1r783&amp;job=checkclass&amp;qclass=12345&amp;rclass=myclass`

Note that for this check to return OK, the class `12345` on wims.unice.fr must
have declared `friend1/myclass` as connectable.
This can be done on an existing class by adding `friend1/myclass` to the `class_connections` parameter in the class `12345` .def file.

_______________________________________________________________________________

## Query output

The query output (that is, the result of the http query) is always of
text/plain type (even if sometimes the output is a binary file).

**WIMS OUTPUT TYPE** : (old fashioned way, non-recommended)
    The first line of the output content is a status line, which is either a
    word OK followed by the random code contained in the request, or the
    word ERROR. If the first line is not as such, then there is a
    serious error in the request or a bug in the server software.
    In case the status is OK, the remaining of the output content is the
    content of the data. Otherwise the second line contains the nature of
    the error.

**JSON OUTPUT TYPE** : (recommended)
    output values are returned json formatted. (see [http://json.org]() for more
    details)

    session number as above. If the user does not exists, the WIMS login is
    returned in the error message.

    OUTPUT :

	* wims_session    : a session number under which the user can connect

	                  be replaced by the character AT (@).
